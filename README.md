# postgresql-lo-stream

This library provides some convenience functions for working with [Large Objects](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/largeobjects.html) in PostgreSQL. This is built on top of [postgresql-simple](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple-LargeObjects.html), which provides the lower-level functions for interacting with Large Objects.
